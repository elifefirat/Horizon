    --  Elif (pseudocode):
      Treemapper: ReadData()
         while reading each line
         Tuple  tuple= new Tuple();
         Set Tuple Value
         Sort Tuple By State Name
         Compute totals Per State()
         Compute Totals per Region()
     //End Read Data()
    
       Render()
    ---------------------
         Draw Region()  // easy
         Draw State() 

         DrawRegion()
           For each region
            DrawRegion
           End for
        EndDrawRegion()

        
         DrawRegion()
           Draw Outer Rectangle
           For each state in region
              DrawState()
           End for
         End Draw Region()
