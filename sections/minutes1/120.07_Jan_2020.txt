    1) We assessed and compared each tool informally based on the quality of the rendering the use of
           color, the presence and legibility of labels, and clearly marked axis scales. (use bullet points)
    2) In order to select appropriate data sets for the literacy test, we assessed them against the following criteria:
       -Multi-dimensional- 4 or more dimensions
       -Size a minimum of 5 records and a maximum of 5000
       -Based on a theme that is not too esoteric
       -Clearly identifiable dimensions
