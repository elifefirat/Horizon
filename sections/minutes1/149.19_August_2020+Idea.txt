Topics Discussed: 
       -- Ligben.lc
       -- Average Polylines



Progress:
	-- Fully randomize questions, Xiaoxiao takes pilot test
	-- Pubquiz- max 20 people
	-- 4 sections: General, pictures, audio, video
	-- User Option: Grid-based polylines intersections computed at run-time
	-- User Option: Dynamic box of intersection


TODO:
	-- Elif send Bob a reminder about meeting with Alark
	-- Try a pilot test with the number of participants Alena recommends
        -- Add "Click in this image to enlarge it" to each question description
	-- Takes notes on what you improved after pilot study
	-- Invite Alena to next meeting and share the pilot study
	-- Start making initial charts of pilot study results
	-- Try jpeg images instead png
	-- Add a pre-experiment question "What device are you using?"
	-- Reduce extra space on sides of tutorial video
	-- Add text progress bar
	-- Find out how much it costs for more than 20 pub quiz participants
	-- Create 10 PCoords images based on density: 1, 10, 100, 500, 1k, 2k,
           4k, 8k, 10k, 20k polylines
	-- Update CGCV team that you have a draft of the pub-quiz
	-- Highlight only current grid cell
	-- Try to make grid cells a square and circle
	-- User Option: Number of boxes along x and y axes
	-- Show polyline intersections for dynamic box
	-- Check "Real-time rendering" book for fast intersection tests- and
           "Real-time collision detection" book
	-- Vis Resources-Summarize first two papers-Educational research papers
           with online resources-Start with 2
	-- Observe Wang's meetings
