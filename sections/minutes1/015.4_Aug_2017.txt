----------------------------------------------
Date:       4 August 2017
Start time: 13:00
End time:   15:00

Date and time of next meeting: 11 August 2017 13:00

Topics discussed: 
    -- Xiaoxiao: Working on coursework
    -- Wang: Today it's officially a nice project
    -- Bob is away 17 August, 22-24 August, 1 September (PhD Viva, Middlesex University)
    -- PhD requirements  


Progress:
    --  Elif: Looked the example programs of Bob
    --  Elif: Showed each state as a rectangle with 2 letter abbreviation, incidence rate + normalized the incidence rate
    --  Elif: Added region to each state
    --  Xiaoxiao: Looked at example programs of Bob
    --  Xiaoxiao: Working on coursework
    --  Wang: Map next to chord diagram
    --  Wang: Within zone trips indicated on map
    --  Wang: All taxi zones includes in visualization(Nice)

TODO:
    08 August 2017
    --  Elif: Draw a rectengular for each region: Same height, width is pr? to normalized incidence rate
    --  Elif: Draw a rectengular for each state: Same width, width is to normalized incidence rate (Next step)
    -------- 
    --  Elif: No magic numbers
    --  Elif: Add 1 more digit of precision to normalized incidence rate exp. 0.02->0.021
    --  Elif: Order rectangular by region: West, Midwest,Southwest,Southeast,Northeast
    --  Elif: Color each rectengular according to region
    --  Elif: Compute normalized incidence rate per region
   

    --  Xiaoxiao: No magic numbers
    --  Xiaoxiao: Write program by hand from strach without and GUI builder programs-No automatically generated code
    --  Xiaoxiao: Re-organize code to look more like Bob's color.java example

    --  Wang: Have a look at"A Survey of Surveys(SOS): Having the landscape of survey papers in information visualization"
    --  Wang: Add a small histogram above sliders
    --  Wang: Have a look at"A survey of traffic data visualization"
    --  Wang: Color map based on number of trips
