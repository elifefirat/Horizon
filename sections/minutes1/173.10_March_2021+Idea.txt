Start time: 11.00
End time:   12.30

Date and time of next meeting: 17 March 2021 11.00

Topics Discussed:
	-- Idea: Difference operator for PCPs (Polyline subtraction)
	-- Comparing hospital, recovery, and deaths across age groups
	-- Sorting axes: by correlation coefficient and collapsing from left to right
	-- Axis ordering based on glyph matrix

Progress:
	-- Next draft of PCP paper with Max's comments
	-- User Option: User chooses axis for color mapping
	-- Re-added glyph options to PCP

TODO:
	-- Have a look at Xmdv software to see how it is organized
           - Find out how they store the data
	-- Update background color of axis label indicate color map being applied to the axis
	-- Include average polyline in context rendering of each age group




    For each age group (for each csv file)
        - Open CSV
	- Read Data 
        - Store it in a data structure
	- Compute correlation coeffiecents
	- Close csv
   End for
