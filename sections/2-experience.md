### Visualization Literacy

The development and comprehension of data visualizations gain importance with the ever-increasing amount of data. My research is based on identifying and addressing barriers to visualization literacy to improve a non-expert user's visualization literacy skills. The aim is to advance user understanding and discovery by revealing patterns with the help of graphical representations. For this, I focus on developing educational visualization tools for specific visualization methods that illustrate data and provide an interactive interface that enables instructors and students to be involved in the process of learning by interacting with the visualization tool.
