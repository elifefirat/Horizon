I am a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Nottingham, working on Visualization Literacy. My research interests are to identify barriers to visualization literacy to improve non-expert usersâ€™ visualization literacy skills by aiding both teaching and learning with a pedagogical tool. I mainly focus on providing solutions to advance data exploration experience in Treemap and Parallel Coordinate Plot.
