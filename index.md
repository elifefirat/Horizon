I am currently working as a lecturer in the Computer Engineering Department at Cukurova University in Turkey. My Ph.D. studies were completed at the University of Nottingham, where I conducted extensive research in information visualization. My primary research interests revolve around identifying barriers to visualization literacy and enhancing the visualization skills of non-expert users through pedagogical tools. My research strongly focuses on advancing the data exploration experience, particularly the Treemaps and Parallel Coordinate Plots. Contact me via email: elifemelfirat@gmail.com or eefirat@cu.edu.tr
